/**
 * Manage services by using an extender that allows for registration of services on behalf of other
 * bundles. An extender abstracts the registration and usage of OSGi services and can be used
 * interchangeably with service API.
 * <p>
 * Register an extender by using the register methods in {@link Extenders} and
 * {@link ExtenderBundleTracker}.
 * <p>
 * To register an extender, the bundle hosting - or owing - and the bundle registering the extender
 * is required. If the owner and registrar bundle is the same, only the owner bundle is required
 * when registering the extender. The bundle registering the extender also becomes the default using
 * bundle when accessing the service registered by the extender. For other bundles using a
 * registered extender service {@link #getService(Bundle)} or the {@link #getExtension(Bundle)} may
 * be used.
 * <p>
 * To register an extender, the same requirements as registering a service with the Framework
 * service API apply.
 * <p>
 * Unregistering a service with the service API automatically unregisters the extender that
 * registered that service.
 * <p>
 * Updating properties using the service API or the extender interface after registration is
 * reflected in both the extender and the Framework.
