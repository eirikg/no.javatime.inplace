/**
 * Service to update bundles. The service is automatically scheduled after a build of activated
 * bundle projects. The scheduled bundles are updated and together with their requiring bundles,
 * stopped, unresolved, resolved, optionally refreshed and started as part of the update process.
 * <p>
 * To manually control and schedule bundle updates, switch off the "Update on Build" option.
 * <p>
 * If the option "Refresh on Update" is off bundle projects are resolved after updated. If bundle
 * projects have more than one revision after resolve, refresh is pending and the status is set to
 * "Refresh Pending". To check if refresh is pending use
 * {@link no.javatime.inplace.region.intface.BundleCommand#getBundleRevisions(org.osgi.framework.Bundle)
 * BundleCommand.getBundleRevisions(Bundle)}
 * <p>
 * Requiring and providing bundles:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Requiring activated bundles to a bundle to update are resolved and optionally refreshed
 * <li>Deactivated bundles imported (providing bundles) by bundles to update are activated. This is
 * handled by the resolver hook. The resolver hook is visited by the framework during resolve.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * ExternalDuplicates
 * <ol>
 * <li>Workspace bundles that are duplicates (bundles with same symbolic name (version may be
 * different)) of external or jar bundles are excluded from the update process and an error status
 * object is generated and reported after update has finished. To access the error objects see
 * {@link #getErrorStatusList()}
 * <li>Workspace duplicates (bundles with same symbolic name as other workspace bundles) and their
 * requiring bundles are in contrast added to the requiring bundles of bundles to update (they are
 * in one way dependent of each other and have to be resolved. External bundles are not resolved)
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * After updated, bundles are moved to the same state as before update if possible.
 * <p>
 * Plug-ins are usually singletons, and it is a requirement, if the plug-in contributes to the UI.
 * When resolving bundles, a collision may occur with earlier resolved bundles with the same
 * symbolic name. In these cases the duplicate (the earlier resolved bundle) is removed and replaced
 * by the new one during the resolve process.
