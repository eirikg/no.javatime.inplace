/**
 * Bundle listener acting on events received from the OSGI framework. Each bundle event consist, as
 * a minimum, of a bundle transition and a bundle state. A bundle command or operation (e.g.
 * refresh) may consist of multiple transitions and thus generate multiple bundle events. Bundle
 * events are either initiated by internal bundle operations in {@link BundleCommandImpl}, from an
 * external source(e.g. the OSGi Bundle Console or a third party bundle) or directly by the
 * framework itself as a consequence of internal or external operations.
 * <p>
 * This class is part of the internal bundle finite state machine implemented in this package and is
 * responsible for generating new transitions based on transitions generated from the framework
 * itself and correct the internal state of the machine based on commands initiated from external
 * sources
 * <p>
 * Events initiated from an external source are marked as external transitions and also flagged as
 * such if the bundle log option is switched on.
 * <p>
 * The framework generates new transitions under the following circumstances:
 * <ol>
 * <li>When a bundle is started due to "on demand class loading" for lazy activated bundles. See
 * comments on the lazy activate and staring events for details.
 * <li>A stop transition is generated when an exception occurs during a start operation. See
 * comments on the stopping and stop events for details.
 * <li>An unresolve transition is generated when an incomplete requiring closure is handed to the
 * resolver by uninstall or refresh. It is by design to not always provide a complete requiring
 * closure to the resolver. See the comments in the unresolve event and unresolve transition for
 * details.
 * <li>A resolve transition is generated when an incomplete providing closure is handed to the
 * resolver by resolve or refresh. This option is not in use. Complete closures are always handed
 * over to the resolver when bundles are resolved.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * An OSGi command is comprised of two or more transitions under the following circumstances:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Resolving a lazy activated bundle. The bundle is first resolved and than lazy activated with
 * terminal state starting
 * <li>Starting a bundle. The first transition is starting with terminal state starting and second
 * started with terminal state active
 * <li>Stopping a bundle. The first transition is stopping with terminal state stopping and second
 * stop with terminal state stopped
 * <li>Uninstalling a bundle in state resolved. Both transitions are uninstall, where the first
 * moves the bundle to state installed and the second to state uninstalled
 * <li>Refreshing a bundle from state resolved. The bundle is first unresolved and than resolved.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The design supports a concept of a region bounded bundle structure (
 * {@link WorkspaceRegionImpl}) acted on by bundle operations ({@link BundleCommandImpl}),
 * which in turn creates a result (events) to interpret and react upon ({@code BundleStateEvents}).
 * This interrelationship is not interpreted as a sequence or a flow, although present, but as a
 * structural coherence.

	 * <p>
	 * The current state of a bundle, which changes after an internal (or external) workspace bundle
	 * operation is executed, is adjusted and recorded along with the bundle in a bundle node. If
	 * received bundle events from the framework deviates from the current recorded state of the
	 * bundle, the transition (operation) who initiated the events is treated as an external operation
	 * and actions are taken to update the bundle node with the new state caused by the external
	 * transition.
	 * <p>
	 * Known events generated by the framework (see class comments) are adjusted after the fact to
	 * maintain a consistent machine state. E.g. when a bundle with lazy activation policy is started
	 * due to "on demand" class loading a new transition is generated moving the bundle from a lazy
	 * activation state to an active state.
	 * <p>
	 * It is allowed to execute external commands both in an activated and a deactivated workspace
	 * except for uninstalling workspace bundles or resolving or starting deactivated bundles in an
	 * activated workspace. Uninstalling workspace bundles in an activated workspace from an external
	 * source is acted upon and bundle operations are executed - either automatically or based on user
	 * choice - to maintain the workspace consistent with the definition of an activated workspace. In
	 * the second case, resolving or starting a deactivated bundle from an external source in an
	 * activated workspace, is rejected by the resolver hook.
