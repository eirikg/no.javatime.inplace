 * Begins an outgoing start and stop transition with {@link org.osgi.framework.Bundle#STARTING

 * bundle in state starting.
 * <p>
 * The stop transition is added for stopping lazy activated bundles but is not according to the OSGi
 * life cycle FSM specification. E.g. OSGi Core Release 5 Chapter 4.4.2. As far as I can see the FSM
 * diagram should include a stop transition with starting as the initial state and stopping or
 * resolve as the terminal state. The bundle has not yet reached state active and there is no
 * transition to move the bundle to state resolved.
