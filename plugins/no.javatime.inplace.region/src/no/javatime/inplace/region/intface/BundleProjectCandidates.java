/**
 * Use this service interface to determine and select valid projects to activate. A project is a
 * candidate for activation if it is a bundle project. A bundle project has the Java and plug-in
 * natures enabled.
 * <p>
 * There is an option to allow/disallow bundle projects that contributes to the UI using the Eclipse
 * UI plug-in to be activated. The default is to allow projects contributing to the UI. Different
 * methods in this class filters bundle projects that contributes to the UI based on the current
 * setting of the UI option.
 * <p>
 * To access and examine bundles projects use the {@link BundleRegion} interface. To activate and
 * deactivate bundle projects use the {@link BundleCommand} interface.
 * <p>
 * There is also a service interface to access and modify bundle project {@link BundleProjectMeta
 * meta information}.
 * <p>
 * Use the OSGi service layer or the {@link Extenders} to access this service interface.
