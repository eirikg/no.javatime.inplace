/**
 * The bundle region isolates all bundles that can be associated with a workspace project from other
 * bundles. Use the bundle region to access, add and modify bundle projects and their attributes.
 * <p>
 * You can access related service interfaces from the bundle region service to manage bundle life
 * cycle, bundle transitions, bundle meta data, project descriptions, and identify candidate bundle
 * projects.
 * <p>
 * There is a 1:1 relationship between a project and its bundle. The term bundle project refers to a
 * project with the java and plug-in nature enabled, the relation (e.g. the symbolic name and
 * version or the location identifier) and the bundle combined.
 * <p>
 * A bundle project is either activated or deactivated. A bundle project is activated when
 * registered or installed with the activated attribute set to {@code true}. A deactivated bundle
 * can be installed but not resolved. If one or more bundle projects are activated the workspace is
 * said to be activated. In a deactivated workspace all bundles are deactivated and individual
 * bundles are in state uninstalled or installed.
